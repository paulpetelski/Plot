# Plot

Plot a sine function in Java console using characters and a 2D array.

###### Example:
Welcome to your 1980s plotter!

What range of x do you want?
From x = -3
to x = 4

what resolution do you want?
How many rows? 30
and how many columns? 40
We'll plot the function from -3.000 to 4.000 on a 30 x 40 grid
